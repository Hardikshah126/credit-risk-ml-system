# 🏦 Credit Risk ML System
Live Demo : https://credit-risk-ml-system-7wjvr7ymtg5we9f9jygeh8.streamlit.app/

An end-to-end **Machine Learning powered credit risk prediction system** that predicts whether a loan applicant is **Safe or High Risk**.

This project combines **Machine Learning, API development, and an interactive dashboard** to simulate how real fintech companies evaluate loan applicants.

Users can enter customer financial details and instantly receive:

✔ Risk prediction
✔ Probability score
✔ Model explanation
✔ Feature impact visualization

🧠 Problem

Banks and financial institutions must evaluate whether a borrower is likely to **default on a loan**.

Traditional risk assessment is slow and subjective.
This project demonstrates how **Machine Learning can automate credit risk evaluation** while also providing **model explainability**.
